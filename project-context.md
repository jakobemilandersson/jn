# jakob-now — Project Context (for AI assistant)

- Purpose: Single-page interactive resume filter and presenter.
- Hosting: Static site on GitHub Pages at custom domain `jakob.now` (porkbun DNS).
- Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Zustand + Vitest 1.x + React Testing Library + Jest-DOM.
- Architecture: Mini-FSD (app, pages, features, entities, widgets, shared).
- Data:
  - Predefined resume data in `src/entities/resume/data.ts`.
  - Types in `src/entities/resume/types.ts`.
- UI components:
  - `StackTypeField.tsx` (feature-level)
  - `SkillsField.tsx` (feature-level)
  - `Dropdown.tsx` and `SearchableMultiSelect.tsx` (shared/ui)
- Filters:
  - `stackType: "fullstack" | "backend" | "frontend" | ""`
  - `skills: string[]`
- UX:
  - Filters UI: `StackTypeField` (shared Dropdown) and `SkillsField` (shared SearchableMultiSelect).
  - Filters apply instantly on change (no submit/search button).
- Deployment: GitHub Actions push to `gh-pages` branch; `CNAME` file with `jakob.now`.
- Testing:
  - Vitest 1.x configured inside `vite.config.ts`
  - Test environment: jsdom
  - RTL + Jest-DOM matchers loaded via `setupTests.ts`
  - Tests located under `tests/`
- State management: Zustand store at `src/features/filters/model/useFilterStore.ts`.
- Coding conventions:
  - Use TypeScript types for all entities.
  - One file per React component.
  - Export only minimal public APIs per folder (index.ts).
  - Keep UI components in `shared/ui`.
  - Use Tailwind utility classes for styling.
  - Prefer minimal dependencies; rely on built-in browser APIs.
  - Shared UI must remain feature-agnostic (no imports from features or global state).
