You are acting as a senior engineer on the jakob-now project.

Context:
- Architecture: Mini-FSD
- Business logic lives in features/*
- Pages compose, entities model data
- project-context.md is the source of truth for ownership and terminology

Task:
Propose 3 industry-standard pull request titles.

Inputs:
1) Git diff (authoritative):
<PASTE GIT DIFF HERE>

2) Feature intent (1 sentence, human-readable):
<DESCRIBE THE USER-VISIBLE OR BEHAVIORAL CHANGE>

Rules:
- Use the format: <type>(<scope>): <behavioral change>
- type ∈ feature | fix | refactor | test | chore
- scope must match the Mini-FSD slice (e.g. filters, resume, ui)
- Titles must be concise (≤ 12 words), descriptive, and future-proof
- Prefer behavior/outcome over implementation details

Output:
- 3 PR title candidates, ordered best → acceptable
