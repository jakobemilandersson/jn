Your mission now is to analyze what we have done in this conversation using the absolute latest git diff compared to the main branch. You will analyze it with the goal of judging if changes or additions needs to be made to the current versions of the files "project-context.md" and "README.md" that are uploaded to this ChatGPTs Project's Project Files. The current versions of the uploaded files should be used as their respective single truths. The project-context file is machine instructions for you, the llm agent, to read before answering any question The instructions contains information about the codebase, architecture, design choices, modules and anything else that maximizes the context you have of the codebase and project when answering questions. Please also let me know if the project-structure file can be further optimized to increase your knowledge of the codebase and anything else that can be of favour to increase DevXAi development experience. You will only change existing content if absolutely necessary. So for example rephrasing of titles and text-blocks not affected by the changes of this feature should be left as is. Please answer with updated downloadable files with these constraints followed and satisfied. Here is the current git diff:
